# Human Symptom Disease Network
This folder contains files useful for mapping MeSH Disease and Symptom names to their corresponding MeSH IDs. The paper
["Human symptomsâ€“disease network"](https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ncomms5212) by *Zhou et al.* created a large network of diseases
and symptoms. The files "Combined-Input.tsv", "Symptom-Occurence-Input.tsv", and "Disease-Occurence-Input.tsv" were taken from
this paper's supplementary data. We have created new output files which also have the MeSH IDs added. [Here](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/LABrueggs/HSDN/blob/master/MeSH-Symptom-Matcher.ipynb)
is a link to the python notebook file that maps these terms to their respective IDs.
